## ‚ùï Additional information

Finally, from now on, I'll start commenting the times between commits.

For example. Estimated time to next commit: 1 day

And as for the versioning of the package, I will adopt the following system.
0.0.0-n.0

The first value means a major update (Change in the general functioning of the program)

The second value means a minor update (Appearance Change, Optimizations, and the like)

The third value means a patch (Basically bug fixing)

The following values after the ( - ) indicate:

a.0: Alpha version, which contains bugs and/or incomplete codes

b.0: Beta version, which contains fewer bugs compared to the previous version and no incomplete code

rc.0: (This version will only be used for major updates or minor updates) indicates that such a version is a favorable candidate for release

Something to mention is that while the first value is 0 it means that the program is in beta.
